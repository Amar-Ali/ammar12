<h1>Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)
</h1>

<P>When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is 
    robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak
     havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.

    Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that<br>
     a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. 
     The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers <br>
      the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception,
       to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems 
       that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any subject. But others remain<br>
     skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human experience.

<h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence

</h2>
<p>  The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different
     sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different
      treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

    Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and 
    self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will 
    impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account 
    for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.
    
    Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking <br>
     and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications
      for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier<br>
       to estimate.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent" target="_blank">click here اضغط هنا</a><br><p></p>
