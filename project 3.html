<h1>History of Artificial Intelligence Research

</h1>

<P><b>In the mid-20th century, a few scientists began exploring a new approach to building intelligent machines, based on
	recent discoveries in neuroscience, a new mathematical theory of information, the development of cybernetics, andabove all, 
	by the invention of the digital computer, a machine that could simulate The human computational thinking process
	He pioneered the modern field of AI research at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956.
	These attendees became leaders in AI research for several decades, notably John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, Allen Noel
	and Herbert Simon who established AI laboratories at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University
	of Carnegie Mellon (CMU) and Stanford, they and their students wrote programs that surprised most people. The computer
	was solving algebra problems, proving logical theorems, and speaking English. By the mid-1960s this research was being
	generously funded by the US Department of Defense. These researchers made the following predictions:<b>

<h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence

</h2>
<p>  The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different
     sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different
      treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

    Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and 
    self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will 
    impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account 
    for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.
    
    Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking <br>
     and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications
      for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier<br>
       to estimate.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent" target="_blank">click here اضغط هنا</a><br><p></p>
