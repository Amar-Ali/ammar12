<h1>   Artificial intelligence problems

</h1>
<P>
   <b> The problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been divided into a 
    number of specific sub-problems. These consist of specific traits or capabilities 
    that researchers would like to embody in an intelligent system. The features listed 
    below have received the most attention.<b>

<h> Special Considerations
</h>
<p>Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common
     theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will
      take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.

    Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even 
    be weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as <br>
    robots should be treated with the same rights as humans.
    
    Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and
     the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars<br>
      would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage.<br>
    
    Another contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect human employment. With<br>
     many industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of intelligent machinery, there is a concern that
      people would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis
     and car-share programs, while manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.<a href=" https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1_%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A"target="blank">click here اضغط هنا لمعرفه المزيد</a> </p>
