<h1>Intelligent designer</h1>

<P>An intelligent designer, also referred to as an intelligent agent, is the hypothetical willed and self-aware entity that the<br>
     intelligent design movement argues had some role in the origin and/or development of life. The term "intelligent cause" is also used, <br>
    implying their teleological supposition of direction and purpose in features of the universe and of living things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent" target="_blank">click here اضغط هنا</a> </P>

<h2>Definitions and characteristics
</h2>
<p>According to Nikola Kasabov (1998),[7] IA systems should exhibit the following characteristics:

    Accommodate new problem solving rules incrementally
    Adapt online and in real time
    Are able to analyze themselves in terms of behavior, error and success.
    Learn and improve through interaction with the environment (embodiment)
    Learn quickly from large amounts of data
    Have memory-based exemplar storage and retrieval capacities
    Have parameters to represent short and long term memory, age, forgetting, etc.
    Padgham & Winikoff (2005) agree that an intelligent agent is situated in an environment and responds (in a timely, though not necessarily real-time) manner to environment changes. However, intelligent agents must also proactively pursue goals in a flexible and robust way.[a] Optional desiderata include that the agent be rational, and that the agent be capable of belief-desire-intention analysis.[8] Some 20th-century definitions characterize an agent as a program that aids a user or that acts on behalf of a user.[9] The influential AIMA (2009) defines an agent as "anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators", and characterizes intelligence as the ability to succeed at acting in accordance with certain ideal standards for rationality.[10][11]
    
    "Intelligent agent" is also often used as a vague marketing term, sometimes synonymous with "virtual personal assistant".[12]    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent" target="_blank">click here اضغط هنا</a><br><p></p>
